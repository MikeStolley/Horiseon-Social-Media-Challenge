# Horiseon Online Impact Challenge

    The changes made to the Horiseon website were mostly in HTML and were semantic elements, with order and duplication being the main issue with the CSS file. Horiseon is a website offering social media marketing, online reputation management, and opitmizing the visibility of search engines to better suit ones own purposes.

# Changes Made

    Overall, no serious changes were made to either files. some semantic names were chosen over div for better structure and sorting purposes, and the css files were ordered so they went in Title-->Header-->Hero-->Content-->Benefits-->Footer, and CSS was also changed and ordered differently to reflect these changes. A new title was chosen that described the purpose of the site, as well as sections being properly placed and indented within each article. the ID's used were within the content section to remove an unnecessary class in CSS, and better compact the code.
